 je_lds_migration: "The Latter Day Saints"
 je_lds_migration_reason: "A recent period of great religious excitement has seen, among other things, the creation of a new sect, calling themselves the Church of the Latter Day Saints. Led by Joseph Smith and holding new scripture, these “Mormons” have been a source of much controversy. They will likely continue to be for some years."
 je_lds_migration_goal: "The LDS decide to leave for greener pastures."
 lds_migration.1.t: "The Assassination of the Smiths"
 lds_migration.1.d: "An angry mob has taken it upon themselves to solve the “Mormon Problem” themselves. Joseph and Hyrum Smith have been killed, and with that, the Church of the Latter Day Saints is decapitated. Without a clear successor, the church has fallen into disorder, as claimants to leadership make their bids and members debate the nature of God's church. One thing is clear to all, however. Nauvoo - and possibly, the United States as a whole - holds no safe haven for the Saints."
 lds_migration.1.f: "“Hyrum was shot first and fell calmly, exclaiming: I am a dead man! Joseph leaped from the window, and was shot dead in the attempt, exclaiming: O Lord my God!”"

 lds_migration.4.d: "Under the leadership of their new prophet, Brigham Young, (WIP: make this link the character) the LDS faithful have founded a new settlement in the western frontier, in the [SCOPE.sState('deseret_capital').GetNameNoFormatting] region. While a new nation has not formally been declared, Young's authority is effectively unchecked in these new settlements, for now."

 lds_premigration.102.a: "WIP: Something interesting"
 lds_premigration.3.t: "Nauvoo Newspaper Destroyed"
 lds_premigration.3.d: "WIP: Something about an opposition/dissenter newspaper getting smashed up after Smith says so"
 lds_premigration.3.f: "WIP: i think we know some of what Smith said at the time? If else a salt sermon/4th of july speech thing could work, something angry at dissenters"

 lds_premigration.4.t: "Arrest of the Smiths"
 lds_premigration.4.d: "Joseph and Hyrum Smith, along with other prominent leaders of their church, have been arrested by county officials to answer for abuses of their civic powers and crimes thereby committed. Significant anger is in the air, and many worry the arrests will not mollify tensions."
 lds_premigration.4.f: "“Citizens ARISE, ONE and ALL!!!—Can you stand by, and suffer such INFERNAL DEVILS! To ROB men of their property and RIGHTS, without avenging them. We have no time for comment, every man will make his own.”"
 lds_premigration.4.a: "Things may get out of hand."
 lds_premigration.5.t: "The Smith Campaign"
 lds_premigration.5.d: "Dissatisfied with the inaction of mainstream politicians regarding major issues of the day, including the persecution of the members of his faith, Joseph Smith has declared his candidacy for the Presidency of the United States. Promising to use federal power to protect the civil rights of US citizens from abuse by the states, alongside a slate of additional major reforms, Smith promises to end partisan bickering and be a president of all Americans, not merely of a party. Many believe it is unlikely he will win much more than his own church."
 lds_premigration.5.f: "Super hanc petram aedificabo"
 lds_premigration.5.a: "He's established himself as a religious reformer."
 lds_premigration.5.b: "He claims to be a Jeffersonian."
 lds_premigration.5.c: "They seem to be calling him General Smith."
 lds_premigration.5.e: "Who cares?"
 lds_premigration.6.t: "A Governor Shot!"
 lds_premigration.6.d: "A near fatal shooting has sent Missouri into a commotion, as a prominent politician has been shot in the head, barely surviving. The victim was the author of the Mormon Extermination Order as governor of Missouri, and as such, all eyes are on the LDS Church - in particular, a close associate of Joseph Smith, one Orrin Porter Rockwell. Rumors abound that Rockwell was sent by Smith as an assassin in revenge for the Mormons, and has been arrested in response."
 lds_premigration.6.f: "“He is undoubtedly killed according to report; but who did the noble deed remains to be found out.”"
 lds_premigration.6.a: "A prominent lawyer has agreed to take on his case."
 lds_premigration.6.b: "Who else could have done it?"
 lds_premigration.6.c: "We'll see what the court thinks."
 lds_premigration.7.t: "Rockwell Convicted!"
 lds_premigration.7.d: "After hearing the testimony of witnesses and a lengthy debate, Porter Rockwell has been sent to prison for murder in the first degree. This has implicated Joseph Smith himself of involvement in a political assassination, a charge he will no doubt resist with all civic powers he holds."
 lds_premigration.7.f: "I was then on terms of close intimacy with Joe Smith, and asked him where Rockwell had gone? “Gone,” said he, “GONE TO FULFILL PROPHECY!”"
 lds_premigration.7.a: "An affront to democracy!"
 lds_premigration.8.t: "Rockwell Released!"
 lds_premigration.8.d: "Following a passioned defense and in light of a lack of firm evidence, Porter Rockwell has been found not guilty of any involvement in the attempted assassination. After serving a brief sentence for a jailbreak he committed while in custody, Rockwell has been released and will be rejoining the body of the church."
 lds_premigration.8.f: "“I've never shot AT anybody. If I shoot, they get shot. He's still alive, isn't he?”"
 lds_premigration.8.a: "Not everyone will believe this."
 lds_premigration.9.t: "The Latter Day Saints"
 lds_premigration.9.d: "A recent period of great religious excitement has seen, among other things, the creation of a new sect, calling themselves the Church of the Latter Day Saints. Led by Joseph Smith and holding new scripture claiming the Americas to be a promised land, these “Mormons” have been a source of much controversy. They will likely continue to be for some years."
 lds_premigration.9.f: "“Notwithstanding our afflictions, we have obtained a land of promise, a land which is choice above all other lands; a land which the Lord God hath ccovenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath covenanted this land unto me, and to my children forever, and also all those who should be led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord.”"
 lds_premigration.9.a: "Okay"
 lds_premigration.10.t: "LDS Farms Attacked"
 lds_premigration.10.d: "WIP: A raid on a number of isolated farms, a relatively small but violent incident."
 lds_premigration.10.f: "WIP: Not sure what to put here. Quote from a victim perhaps? happened a couple times"
 lds_premigration.10.a: "Unfortunate."
 lds_premigration.10.b: "Help them rebuild."
 lds_premigration.11.t: "Double Vigilantism"
 lds_premigration.11.d: "A large armed mob, including Joseph Smith, have surrounded several public officials at their homes and forced them to sign documents disavowing vigilantes. Some of these officials were rumored to be gathering anti-mormon mobs themselves, though none had done so as of yet."
 lds_premigration.11.f: "“...witness refused to do so, and told him that if his oath and the laws of the country did not bind him, a written obligation would be no more binding, and told him if he or his company had been injured in any way, he, the witness, would issue process, and bring the offenders to justice.”"
 lds_premigration.11.a: "Intimidation of public officials is unacceptable."
 lds_premigration.11.b: "Well, did they sign?"
 lds_premigration.12.t: "The Salt Sermon"
 lds_premigration.12.d: "Following a small schism within the LDS church, a series of firey sermons have been given by a prominent church leader, Sydney Rigdeon, denouncing dissenters and enemies of the church and asserting they will be “trodden under foot.” Some within the church have taken this as approval for a more militant direction, and have formed a militia, the Danites, in response, to carry out this prophecy."
 lds_premigration.12.f: "“If the salt have lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.”"
 lds_premigration.12.a: "Alarming."
 lds_premigration.13.t: "LDS Settlements Expanding"
 lds_premigration.13.d: "Local settlements by the LDS Church have been recently expanding beyond traditionally LDS territory, increasing their local political and economic power and putting many anti-Mormons on edge. Some have begun demanding action to protect non-Mormons from being politically overwhelmed."
 lds_premigration.13.f: "“Why is it that a proclamation is made by the Prophet just at this time calling in all the "saints abroad" to settle in this county? Why is it that the Mormons here, in all former contests, uniformly voted as one man in favor of the candidate of Joe Smith's choice? \n Whatever may be thought of their present strength, it is certain, that if not checked in another year, they will have the decided majority in this county. Yes! men who have no minds of their own, but move, act and think at the bidding of one man, are to be our rulers.”"
 lds_premigration.13.a: "Carve out a county for the Mormons specifically as a compromise."
 lds_premigration.13.b: "A swing demographic could make this state more influential on the national stage."
 lds_premigration.14.t: "Rumors of Theocracy"
 lds_premigration.14.d: "WIP: people are antsy about Smith being a theocrat"
 lds_premigration.14.f: "WIP: something about theodemocracy"
 lds_premigration.14.a: "Concerning, if true."
 lds_premigration.15.t: "Rumors of Infidelity"
 lds_premigration.15.d: "Rumors have been cycling about sexual impropriety among the leadership of the LDS church, ranging from the practice of so-called “spiritual wifery” by certain members, to the full institution of polygamy by the church itself. The Church, for its part, has denied the practice and excommunicated anyone claiming “spiritual wives.”"
 lds_premigration.15.f: "“Inasmuch as this church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication, and polygamy: we declare that we believe, that one man should have one wife; and one woman, but one husband, except in case of death, when either is at liberty to marry again.”"
 lds_premigration.15.a: "Strange rumors."
 lds_premigration.16.t: "Election Violence"
 lds_premigration.16.d: "A small local election has turned violent, after an anti-Mormon mob attempted to prevent church members from voting - only to be met by a mob of the LDS, who fought them off. It isn't believed that any suppression efforts were successful."
 lds_premigration.16.f: "“If you suffer such men as these to vote, you will soon lose your suffrage.”"
 lds_premigration.16.a: "An unfortunate incident."
 lds_premigration.16.b: "Unfortunate it didn't work."
