 je_lds_migration: "The Latter Day Saints"
 je_lds_migration_reason: "A recent period of great religious excitement has seen, among other things, the creation of a new sect, calling themselves the Church of the Latter Day Saints. Led by Joseph Smith and holding new scripture, these “Mormons” have been a source of much controversy. They will likely continue to be for some years."
 je_lds_migration_goal: "The LDS decide to leave for greener pastures."
 lds_migration.1.t: "The Assassination of the Smiths"
 lds_migration.1.d: "An angry mob has taken it upon themselves to solve the “Mormon Problem” themselves. Joseph and Hyrum Smith have been killed, and with that, the Church of the Latter Day Saints is decapitated. Without a clear successor, the church has fallen into disorder, as claimants to leadership make their bids and members debate the nature of God's church. One thing is clear to all, however. Nauvoo - and possibly, the United States as a whole - holds no safe haven for the Saints."
 lds_migration.1.f: "“Hyrum was shot first and fell calmly, exclaiming: I am a dead man! Joseph leaped from the window, and was shot dead in the attempt, exclaiming: O Lord my God!”"
 lds_migration.1.a: "And where do they intend to go?"
 lds_migration.2.t: "LDS Ceded"
 lds_migration.2.d: "As a side effect of recent international developments, the LDS church and its leaders are no longer our problem."
 lds_migration.2.f: "At least that's one thing we don't have to worry about."
 lds_migration.2.a: "Okay"
 lds_migration.3.t: "LDS Tensions Simmer"
 lds_migration.3.d: "It has been many years since the founding of the LDS faith, and while detractors and tensions still abound, it seems that people have accepted the faith is likely here to stay."
 lds_migration.3.a: "They've made a permanent home of [SCOPE.sState('mormon_homeland_state').GetNameNoFormatting]."
 lds_migration.4.t: "The Founding of Deseret"
 lds_migration.4.d: "Following a succession crisis, the LDS have rallied under the leadership of [SCOPE.sCharacter('deseret_leader').GetFullName], and have founded a new settlement in the western frontier, in the [SCOPE.sState('deseret_state').GetNameNoFormatting] region. While a new nation has not formally been declared, the authority of the church's leadership is effectively unchecked in these new settlements, for now."
 lds_migration.4.f: "“This is the place.”"
 lds_migration.4.a: "Good riddance."
 lds_migration.4.b: "I shall join them!"
 lds_migration.5.t: "The Founding of Deseret"
 lds_migration.5.d: "Under the leadership of their new prophet, [SCOPE.sCharacter('deseret_leader').GetFullName], the LDS faithful have founded a new settlement in the western frontier, in the [SCOPE.sState('deseret_state').GetNameNoFormatting] region. While a new nation has not formally been declared, Smith's authority is effectively unchecked in these new settlements, for now."
 lds_migration.5.f: "“We, the Saints of God, are a going to Zion.”"
 lds_migration.5.a: "Good riddance."
 lds_migration.5.b: "I shall join them!"
 lds_migration.6.t: "The Founding of Deseret"
 lds_migration.6.d: "Under the leadership of [SCOPE.sCharacter('deseret_leader').GetFullName], and in light of recent developments in their home country, the LDS faithful have founded a new settlement in the western frontier, in the [SCOPE.sState('deseret_state').GetNameNoFormatting] region. While a new nation has not formally been declared, Smith's authority is effectively unchecked in these new settlements, for now."
 lds_migration.6.f: "“Anyplace where the Saints gather is Zion, which every righteous man will build up for a place of safety for his children.”"
 lds_migration.6.a: "Good riddance."
 lds_migration.6.b: "I shall join them!"
 lds_migration.7.t: "The Zion Revolt"
 lds_migration.7.d: "Among the states joining our confederacy is [SCOPE.sState('lds_rebel_state').GetName], containing the current headquarters of the LDS church. Decrying our secession as illegal and a danger to their freedoms, the church has revolted against their state government to create a “State of Zion.”"
 lds_migration.7.f: "“We warn all men in the name of Jesus Christ, to come on us no more forever. For from this hour, we will bear it no more, our rights shall no more be trampled on with impunity. The man or the set of men, who attempts it, does it at the expense of their lives.”"
 lds_migration.7.a: "Bothersome."
 lds_migration.7.b: "Play as Zion"
 lds_migration.8.t: "The Zion Revolt"
 lds_migration.8.d: "With the emergence of the so-called Confederate States, the headquarters of the LDS sect has passed into rebel hands. The faith has, in turn, rose up in rebellion against the Confederates, seeking to create a “State of Zion,” which they hope will stand for their interests in the future."
 lds_migration.8.f: "“We warn all men in the name of Jesus Christ, to come on us no more forever. For from this hour, we will bear it no more, our rights shall no more be trampled on with impunity. The man or the set of men, who attempts it, does it at the expense of their lives.”"
 lds_migration.8.a: "We will stand together against the slavers, then!"
 lds_migration.8.b: "They will fall before the year is out."
 lds_migration.8.c: "A rebel is a rebel."
 lds_migration.9.t: "An End to Liberty"
 lds_migration.9.d: "Recent changes in American law have reportedly left Joseph Smith and members of his church deeply shaken. Decrying the “death of this American republic,” plans have reportedly been made to flee to the frontier, "
 lds_migration.9.f: "“The aspirations and expectations of a virtuous people, environed with so wise, so liberal, so deep, so broad, and so high a charter of equal rights, as appears in said Constitution, ought to be treated by those to whom the administration of the laws are intrusted, with as much sanctity, as the prayers of the saints are treated in heaven.”"
 lds_migration.9.a: "So be it."
 lds_premigration.1.t: "The Kirtland Safety Society"
 lds_premigration.1.d: "A quasi-bank, run by the leadership of the LDS Church, has just collapsed, losing a significant amount of money once owned by the faith's members. Dissent and schism has emerged in this church at the highest levels in light of this catastrophe, prompting Smith and his remaining allies to flee Ohio and move the Church's headquarters to a site in Missouri, where many of the faith's members have already gathered."
 lds_premigration.1.f: "“Let the city, Far West, be a holy and consecrated land unto me; and it shall be called most holy, for the ground upon which thou standest is holy.”"
 lds_premigration.1.a: "Just another bank failure."
 lds_premigration.101.t: "An American Religion"
 lds_premigration.101.d: "With the recent change in Ohio's legal status, Joseph Smith has opted to move himself and his church's headquarters west, to Missouri, where much of the faith awaits him."
 lds_premigration.101.f: "“Let the city, Far West, be a holy and consecrated land unto me; and it shall be called most holy, for the ground upon which thou standest is holy.”"
 lds_premigration.101.a: "Okay"
 lds_premigration.2.t: "The Mormon War"
 lds_premigration.2.d: "The peace between the Mormons and their neighbors has completely collapsed in the last few months, with a series of battles, raids, and looting across the northwest of Missouri culminating in the “Extermination Order,” an executive order demanding the removal of all Mormons from the state. A new settlement for the faith, now named Nauvoo, is being set up in the neighboring state of [SCOPE.sState('nauvoo_scope').GetName]."
 lds_premigration.2.f: "“It is a beautiful site, and it shall be called Nauvoo, which means in Hebrew a beautiful plantation.”"
 lds_premigration.2.a: "Where will they go, if this too doesn't work out?"
 lds_premigration.102.t: "The Mormon War"
 lds_premigration.102.d: "The peace between the Mormons and their neighbors has completely collapsed in the last few months, with a series of battles, raids, and looting across the northwest of Missouri culminating in the “Extermination Order,” an executive order demanding the removal of all Mormons from the state. A new settlement for the faith, now named Nauvoo, is being set up in the neighboring state of [SCOPE.sState('nauvoo_scope').GetName], now in the nation of [SCOPE.sC('nauvoo_owner_scope').GetName]."
 lds_premigration.102.f: "“It is a beautiful site, and it shall be called Nauvoo, which means in Hebrew a beautiful plantation.”"
 lds_premigration.102.a: "No longer our problem, then."
 lds_premigration.3.t: "Nauvoo Newspaper Destroyed"
 lds_premigration.3.d: "A newspaper, opposed to the policies and doctrines of the leadership of Nauvoo and the LDS Church, has recently been destroyed on the order of Joseph Smith and City of Nauvoo, who declared the paper a “public nuisance.” The paper, recently created by LDS dissenters, alledged that Smith teaches polygamy and polytheism, and excommunicates rivals without proper process."
 lds_premigration.3.f: "“We most solemnly and sincerely declare, God this day being witness of the truth and sincerity of our designs and statements, that happy will it be with those who examine and scan Joseph Smith's pretensions to righteousness; and take counsel of human affairs, and of the experience of times gone by... We hope many items of doctrine, as now taught, some of which, however, are taught secretly, and denied openly, (which we know positively is the case,) and others publicly, considerate men will treat with contempt; for we declare them heretical and damnable in their influence, though they find many devotees.”"
 lds_premigration.3.a: "He'll go to court for this."
 lds_premigration.3.b: "Give Smith a taste of the same."
 lds_premigration.4.t: "Arrest of the Smiths"
 lds_premigration.4.d: "Joseph and Hyrum Smith, along with other prominent leaders of their church, have been arrested by county officials to answer for abuses of their civic powers and crimes thereby committed. Significant anger is in the air, and many worry the arrests will not mollify tensions."
 lds_premigration.4.f: "“Citizens ARISE, ONE and ALL!!!—Can you stand by, and suffer such INFERNAL DEVILS! To ROB men of their property and RIGHTS, without avenging them. We have no time for comment, every man will make his own.”"
 lds_premigration.4.a: "Things may get out of hand."
 lds_premigration.5.t: "The Smith Campaign"
 lds_premigration.5.d: "Dissatisfied with the inaction of mainstream politicians regarding major issues of the day, including the persecution of the members of his faith, Joseph Smith has declared his candidacy for the Presidency of the United States. Promising to use federal power to protect the civil rights of US citizens from abuse by the states, alongside a slate of additional major reforms, Smith promises to end partisan bickering and be a president of all Americans, not merely of a party. Many believe it is unlikely he will win much more than his own church."
 lds_premigration.5.f: "Super hanc petram aedificabo"
 lds_premigration.5.a: "He's established himself as a religious reformer."
 lds_premigration.5.b: "He claims to be a Jeffersonian."
 lds_premigration.5.c: "They seem to be calling him General Smith."
 lds_premigration.5.e: "Who cares?"
 lds_premigration.6.t: "A Governor Shot!"
 lds_premigration.6.d: "A near fatal shooting has sent Missouri into a commotion, as a prominent politician has been shot in the head, barely surviving. The victim was the author of the Mormon Extermination Order as governor of Missouri, and as such, all eyes are on the LDS Church - in particular, a close associate of Joseph Smith, one Orrin Porter Rockwell. Rumors abound that Rockwell was sent by Smith as an assassin in revenge for the Mormons, and has been arrested in response."
 lds_premigration.6.f: "“He is undoubtedly killed according to report; but who did the noble deed remains to be found out.”"
 lds_premigration.6.a: "A prominent lawyer has agreed to take on his case."
 lds_premigration.6.b: "Who else could have done it?"
 lds_premigration.6.c: "We'll see what the court thinks."
 lds_premigration.7.t: "Rockwell Convicted!"
 lds_premigration.7.d: "After hearing the testimony of witnesses and a lengthy debate, Porter Rockwell has been sent to prison for murder in the first degree. This has implicated Joseph Smith himself of involvement in a political assassination, a charge he will no doubt resist with all civic powers he holds."
 lds_premigration.7.f: "I was then on terms of close intimacy with Joe Smith, and asked him where Rockwell had gone? “Gone,” said he, “GONE TO FULFILL PROPHECY!”"
 lds_premigration.7.a: "An affront to democracy!"
 lds_premigration.8.t: "Rockwell Released!"
 lds_premigration.8.d: "Following a passioned defense and in light of a lack of firm evidence, Porter Rockwell has been found not guilty of any involvement in the attempted assassination. After serving a brief sentence for a jailbreak he committed while in custody, Rockwell has been released and will be rejoining the body of the church."
 lds_premigration.8.f: "“I've never shot AT anybody. If I shoot, they get shot. He's still alive, isn't he?”"
 lds_premigration.8.a: "Not everyone will believe this."
 lds_premigration.9.t: "The Latter Day Saints"
 lds_premigration.9.d: "A recent period of great religious excitement has seen, among other things, the creation of a new sect, calling themselves the Church of the Latter Day Saints. Led by Joseph Smith and holding new scripture claiming the Americas to be a promised land, these “Mormons” have been a source of much controversy. They will likely continue to be for some years."
 lds_premigration.9.f: "“Notwithstanding our afflictions, we have obtained a land of promise, a land which is choice above all other lands; a land which the Lord God hath ccovenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath covenanted this land unto me, and to my children forever, and also all those who should be led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord.”"
 lds_premigration.9.a: "Okay"
 lds_premigration.10.t: "Slaveowners Protest Missionaries"
 lds_premigration.10.d: "Several slaveowners have begun complaining that missionaries of the LDS church have been influencing their slaves to adopt strange and undesirable ideas. The church has previously advised not to preach to slaves without the permission of their masters, but the recent contentions have created a need to review the policy."
 lds_premigration.10.f: "“...but we do not believe it right to interfere with bond-servants, neither preach the gospel to, nor baptize them, contrary to the will and wish of their masters, nor to meddle with, or influence them in the least to cause them to be dissatisfied with their situations in this life, thereby jeopardizing the lives of men: such interference we believe to be unlawful and unjust, and dangerous to the peace of every Government allowing human beings to be held in servitude.”"
 lds_premigration.10.a: "We should reaffirm the policy, rather than stir up any trouble."
 lds_premigration.10.b: "We should preach the gospel to all peoples, slaveowners be damned."
 lds_premigration.11.t: "Double Vigilantism"
 lds_premigration.11.d: "A large armed mob, consisting of LDS men and including Joseph Smith, have surrounded several public officials at their homes and forced them to sign documents disavowing vigilantes. Some of these officials were rumored to be gathering anti-mormon mobs themselves, though none had done so as of yet. Those in the church who were not present debate whether this act was justified - or wise."
 lds_premigration.11.f: "“...witness refused to do so, and told him that if his oath and the laws of the country did not bind him, a written obligation would be no more binding, and told him if he or his company had been injured in any way, he, the witness, would issue process, and bring the offenders to justice.”"
 lds_premigration.11.a: "We need assurances in dangerous times."
 lds_premigration.11.b: "It seems unwise to provoke people."
 lds_premigration.12.t: "The Salt Sermon"
 lds_premigration.12.d: "Following a small schism within the LDS church, a series of firey sermons have been given by a prominent church leader, Sydney Rigdeon, denouncing dissenters and enemies of the church and asserting they will be “trodden under foot.” Some within the church have taken this as approval for a more militant direction, and have formed a militia, the Danites, in response, to carry out this prophecy. Church members are divided by this development."
 lds_premigration.12.f: "“If the salt have lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.”"
 lds_premigration.12.a: "An excellent development."
 lds_premigration.12.b: "So long as they continue to respect the authority of the Prophet."
 lds_premigration.12.c: "An alarming development - more violence is the last thing we need."
 lds_premigration.13.t: "LDS Settlements Expanding"
 lds_premigration.13.d: "Local settlements by the LDS Church have been recently expanding beyond traditionally LDS territory, increasing their local political and economic power and putting many anti-Mormons on edge. Some have begun demanding action to protect non-Mormons from being politically overwhelmed."
 lds_premigration.13.f: "“Why is it that a proclamation is made by the Prophet just at this time calling in all the "saints abroad" to settle in this county? Why is it that the Mormons here, in all former contests, uniformly voted as one man in favor of the candidate of Joe Smith's choice? \n Whatever may be thought of their present strength, it is certain, that if not checked in another year, they will have the decided majority in this county. Yes! men who have no minds of their own, but move, act and think at the bidding of one man, are to be our rulers.”"
 lds_premigration.13.a: "Carve out a county for the Mormons specifically as a compromise."
 lds_premigration.13.b: "A swing demographic could make this state more influential on the national stage."
 lds_premigration.14.t: "Rumors of Theocracy"
 lds_premigration.14.d: "Rumors have began to swirl around Joseph Smith's civic powers and theocratic ambitions, and the supposed ideals of his concept of “Theodemocracy.” Those outside his church are suspicious of such talk, while those within discuss the true meaning of these ideals."
 lds_premigration.14.f: "“I go emphatically, virtuously, and humanely, for a THEODEMOCRACY, where God and the people hold the power to conduct the affairs of men in righteousness.”"
 lds_premigration.14.a: "We will build the Kingdom of God where we stand."
 lds_premigration.14.b: "Democracy is the will of God and men alike."
 lds_premigration.15.t: "Rumors of Infidelity"
 lds_premigration.15.d: "Rumors have been cycling about sexual impropriety among the leadership of the LDS church, ranging from the practice of so-called “spiritual wifery” by certain members, to the full institution of polygamy by the church itself. The Church, for its part, has denied the practice and excommunicated anyone claiming “spiritual wives.” The body of the church has responded to these rumors in various ways."
 lds_premigration.15.f: "“Inasmuch as this church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication, and polygamy: we declare that we believe, that one man should have one wife; and one woman, but one husband, except in case of death, when either is at liberty to marry again.”"
 lds_premigration.15.a: "An abominable idea."
 lds_premigration.15.b: "The leaders of the church would not institute false doctrines."
 lds_premigration.16.t: "Election Violence"
 lds_premigration.16.d: "A small local election has turned violent, after an anti-Mormon mob attempted to prevent church members from voting - only to be met by a mob of the LDS, who fought them off. It isn't believed that any suppression efforts were successful, and local politicians and newsmen have been debating the cause and consequence of such a dramatic incident."
 lds_premigration.16.f: "“If you suffer such men as these to vote, you will soon lose your suffrage.”"
 lds_premigration.16.a: "An unfortunate incident."
 lds_premigration.16.b: "Unfortunate it didn't work."
 
 lds_institutional_tt: "The LDS mainstream will favor more reliance on the church as a worldly institution."
 lds_defensive_tt:     "The LDS mainstream will favor more defensive and evasive sentiments on self-preservation."
 lds_anti_racist_tt:   "The LDS mainstream will be more sympathetic to anti-racist rhetoric."
 lds_aggressive_tt:    "The LDS mainstream will favor more assertive and aggressive sentiments on self-preservation."
 lds_theocrat_tt:      "The LDS mainstream will embrace more theocratic sentiments."
 lds_anti_polygamy_tt: "The LDS mainstream will consider polygamy an absurd and outrageous proposal."
 lds_polygamy_tt:      "The LDS mainstream will be mostly unconcerned about polygamy as an issue."
